## General Questions

- Tell me about yourself:
	- I'm a student at FIU doing a master's in Computer Science. I'm about to graduate after my Spring semester. Before that I got a bachelors in Computer Engineering at FIU as well. Because of this I'm used to working with both computer software and hardware.
	- I've always enjoyed working with computers, and I've even started learning Linux. It's interesting to create scripts or trying out new things in the terminal. 
	
- Why whould we hire you?
	- I think I'm a good fit for the position. 
	- I've worked with computers both inside and outside of school. At home, I'm the 'computer' person, so I've always helped my family with all kinds of tech issues. I'm familiar with setting up their emails, replacing old hard drives, managing cables, and setting up things like projectors. 
	- I also have experience volunteering at an elementary school taking care of kids during summer camp. So I have experience trying to talk to kids who can only vaguely describe their problem and then work together to find a solution. 
	- I'm a good problem solver. To solve a problem, you first need to know what the problem is and collect more information about it. For example, if someone's computer won't turn on, there's a few questions to ask and investigate. Things like 'is the cable loose?, is there a problem with the computer itself?, is the monitor dead?, or did the computer get a virus?'
	
- What are your greatest strengths?
	- I'd say one of my greatest strength is communication in a sense. I'm a straightforward person. If I don't know something and I really can't figure it out on my own, I will ask someone who does.
	- I also have to say that I pay attention to the details, so if something isn't very clear or mentioned then I'll try to bring it up. For example, for my senior design project, we designed a smart interactive mirror. When we were finalizing the design, I noticed that we didn't pay attention to its weight and how or if the mirror would be mounted on a wall. If the mirror was too heavy then it would have to have its own supports/feet to stand on its own. If it was light enough, then we could try to hang it on the wall.
	
- What are your greatest weaknesses?
	- I can get nervous when things get close to or past a deadline. I start getting like the butterflies in my stomach, so I always strive to finish projects on time or earlier. Its nice to have breathing room in case of unexpected emergencies and there's no stress of 'I have to turn in this 10 page report in 4 hours!'
	- I don't have any work experience prior to this, so there could be instances where I'm not very "professional", but I hope to learn all about that in this internship. 

- What is your greatest professional(academic) achievement?
	- In my senior design project, besides writing some of the software for the smart mirror, I was in charge of the schedule/timeline for the project. 
	- We were given around 6 months to finish everything, from writing the report, giving updates to the professor, turning designs, finishing the physical project, and creating a presentation to demonstrate our project. 
	- I had to determine when each group members parts should be done, and when to do what things. For instance, the software couldn't be fully tested until the mirror was actually done being built, so if the hardware construction was delayed, so would the software.
	- We met all deadlines throughout the project and even finished a bit early at the end. 

- Tell Me About a Work Problem That Required a Complicated Solution and How You Worked With Your Team to Resolve It.
	- During my senior design project, we had one of our team member catch covid.
	- This caused a shift in things, since we usually met up to work on the project. He was also the one in charge of the physical part of the project like cutting the wood frame and fitting the parts together. 
	- We couldn't cause a delay, since we needed the hardware completed to finish testing the software. 
	- So while he was in lockdown we had him work on the report, while the construction of the physical project was divided between the rest of the group. 
	- We were able to meet finish construction in time. 

-  Tell Me About a Time When You Explained a Technical Process or Concept to Someone Who Didn’t Have a Technical Background.
	- I was explaining how one of my homework programs works to my Dad.
	- I related it to a rube goldberg machine.
	- There is a final goal to accomplish, which is the program output, and there's nearly infinite ways to design a code/contraption to do it. 
	- The basic premise is the same where there is a beginning and an end, and between that theres a variety of steps. 
	- In a rube goldberg machine, theres simple machines like pulleys and levers, while in programming theres functions and logic.

-  What’s the Best Team You’ve Ever Been a Part of, and Why?/What’s Your Ideal Team?
	- I believe communication is the key to success in a team. The objective of a team/group is to work together to complement each others strengths and cover each others weaknesses, but you can't really do that without talking to each other.
	- I had a group project to create a presentation on Air Traffic Control Security, and my group met quickly to discuss the topic and divide the work. After that we regularly posted our work on a shared Google Slide 

- What’s One Challenge You’ve Faced, and How Did You Overcome It?
	- During a recent group research paper, one of the members had not been very cooperative. He wasn't talking nor posting his work like the rest of the group. We hadn't heard from him in awhile. So I went to talk to him directly to figure out what was going on. It turned out he had some issues at home, becase his kid caught covid, so he was just really busy. I told him that was fine, but to just keep us updated on the situation, so that the rest of the team could adjust if needed. 

- Tell Us About a Time You Had to Learn Something Completely New.
	- While doing my bachelors degree, I had to take a class on circuits. Up to that point I've done mostly programming, so learning about how electricity moves and different kinds of gates, was somewat difficult. I spent alot of time googling questions, reading the textbook, and asking the TA for help. 
	- Eventually, I ended up doing pretty well on the exams.
