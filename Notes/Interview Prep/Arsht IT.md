- INTRO:
	- Hi, I'm Christopher, it's a pleasure to meet you.
	- Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today.
	- I appreciate being considered for this role.

- Why do you want to intern at the Arsht Center?
	- Well, this would be my first job and I wanted it to be in a field that I'm comfortable with. I've worked with computers for years inside and outside of school. 
	- Since I'm the computer person in my family, most of them come to me when they have problems. For example, I've had to fix hardware issues like broken fans, replacing hard drives, or cable problems. I've also dealt various software problems like recovering lost files, booting issues, partitioning storage, and helping my Mom get her email on her phone.
	- So helping others isn't something new to me.
	- I'm hoping that this opportunity at the Arsht Center will give me more exposure to other technology that I haven't interacted with before, for instance, I'm curious to know how all the lights, speakers, microphones are maintained and controlled. Are they all connected to a server or is there custom software to manage them?
-   How would this Internship help you reach your future goals?
	- I'm confident in my computer skills, but I want to have real world experience. As mentioned before this would be my first job, so I want to meet and learn from others who have much more experience than me. I also want to familiarise myself with how a professional environment operates. 
-   Are you looking for a career in Arts Management? 
	- I don't know alot about arts management, can you tell me more about it?
	- I'm more of a tech person.
	- I'm looking for a career in IT or Software Engineering.
	- arts administration
	- business administration technics and processes to the art world
-   What interests you the most about Arts Management?
	- N/A
	- Interests about IT/Software Engineering:
		- I like working with technology and creating things.
		- For example, I like to mess around with my raspberry pi.
		- For my Senior Design project, I even colloborated with my group to make a smart mirror that runs off a raspberry pi.
-   Tell us what you are most passionate about learning – professionally. And why?
	- Like most computer science students, I'm a programmer at heart, but besides that I would have to say I enjoy learning about Linux. After using windows for so many years, Linux is like a breath of fresh air. It gives me the freedom to do whatever I want with the system. It allows me to apply my programming skills to create scripts to automate or create new functionality. 
-   Tell us about your volunteer or community service experience.
	- I've volunteered at my local elementary school's summer camp. I was a group leader in charge of 20 kids. I would coordinate with teachers and other group leaders to create fun events like races or plays for the kids. It wasn't always peaceful though beacause I've had to mediate fights and arguments between the kids. Over time I've had to learn how to be very patient because kids don't tend to be the very resonable or understanding. 
-   Do you have prior scheduling commitments or conflicts with a January start date?
	- Aside from my University schedule, I do not. 
-   If you aren’t selected for (specific dept), what other departments would you be interested in working with and why?
	-   IT, Marketing, Public Relations, Accounting, Programming, Arts Education, Production, Front of House
	- I would be interested in the Programming Department. I'm curious to know what kind of software development goes behind hosting plays and concerts. 

- OUTRO:
	- Thanks for taking the time to talk today.
	- I really enjoyed talking about this opportunity.
	- Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have more questions about me, or if you'd like to schedule another time to chat. 
	- Have a great day.
