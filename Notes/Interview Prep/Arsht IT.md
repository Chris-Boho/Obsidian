-   Why do you want to intern at the Arsht Center?
	- Well, this would be my first job and I wanted it to be in a field that I'm comfortable with. I've worked with computers for years inside and outside of school. 
	- Since I'm the computer person in my family, most of them come to me when they have problems. For example, I've had to fix hardware issues like broken fans, replacing hard drives, or screen flickering. I've also dealt various software problems like recovering lost files, booting issues, partitioning storage, and helping my Mom get her email on her phone.
	- I'm hoping that this opportunity at the Arsht Center will give me more exposure to other technology that I haven't interacted with before, for instance, I'm curios to know how all the lights, speakers, microphones are maintained and controlled.
-   How would this Internship help you reach your future goals?
	- I'm confident in my computer skills, but I want to have real world experience. As mentioned before this would be my first job, so I want to meet and learn from others who have much more experience than me. I also want to familiarise myself with  how a professional environment operates.
-   Are you looking for a career in Arts Management? 
	- No I'm more of a tech person.
-   What interests you the most about Arts Management?
	- N/A
-   Tell us what you are most passionate about learning – professionally. And why?
	- Like most computer science students, I'm a programmer at heart, but besides that I would have to say I enjoy learning about Linux. After using windows for so many years, Linux is like a breath of fresh air. It gives me the freedom to do whatever I want with the system. Its great that I can apply my programming skills to create scripts to automate or create new functionality. 
-   Tell us about your volunteer or community service experience.
	- I've volunteered at my local elementary school's summer camp. I was a group leader in charge of 20 kids. I would coordinate with teachers and other group leaders to create fun events like races or plays for the kids. It wasn't always peaceful though beacause I've had to mediate fights and arguments between the kids. Over time I've had to learn how to be very patient because kids don't tend to be the very resonable or understanding. 
-   Do you have prior scheduling commitments or conflicts with a January start date?
	- Aside from my University schedule, I do not. 
-   If you aren’t selected for (specific dept), what other departments would you be interested in working with and why?
	-   IT, Marketing, Public Relations, Accounting, Programming, Arts Education, Production, Front of House
	- I would be interested in the Programming Department. I'm curious to know what kind of software development goes behind hosting plays and concerts.
