### Vulnerability Scanning
- automated e-commerce threat that uses bots or web crawlers to identify security weaknesses in your website and underlying architecture

### Reconnaissance
- inspection or exploration of an area, especially one made to gather military information
- mapping of target to a set of IP addresses
- Steps:
	1.  Intelligence gathering
		- find out more about structure of target (or organization)
	2. Footprinting
		- find out individual computers of target
			- IP addresses
			- DNS names
	3. Verification
		- check if targets are 'alive' and reachable

- Ping Sweep
	- check for live systems
	- ICMP ping 
	- TCP ping
	- ARP ping

- Port Scanning
	- TCP/UDP ports
	- send a packet and then check response

- OS Fingerprinting
	- find out which OS runs on the system
	- clues can be found from open ports

- Error Handling
	- errors returned to user can contain information that gives clues on how the servers work
