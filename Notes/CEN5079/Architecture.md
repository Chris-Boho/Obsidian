### Security Architecture
- a body of high-level design principles and decisions that allow a programmer to judge the security with confidence
- a framework for secure design, which embodies the four classic stages of information security
	- Protect
	- Deter
	- Detect
	- React
- Security is a measure of the architecture's ability to resist unauthorized usage 

## Design Principles
- #### Economy of Mechanism
	- design should be as simple as possible
	- black-box / functional testing
- #### Fail-safe defaults
	- deny as default action
		- grant acess only on explicit permission
	- new accounts dont have admin privileges
	- minimum password length
	- files are write protected
- #### Complete Mediation
	- complete access control
		- check every access to every object
		- identification of authentication for action
	- trusted path
		- make sure user is talking to authentication program
		- any value that can be influenced by user cannot be trusted
- #### Open Design
	- open source
	- a system should be secure even if the adversary knows everything about its design
	- doesnt not include things like secret keys
	- allows review
	- established trust
	- security depends on secrecy of few, small tokens
		- keys 
		- passwords
- #### Separation of Privilege
	- Access depends on more than one condition
		- for example, two keys are required to access a resource two privileges can be physically distributed
		- EX: launch of nukes requires two people
	- Compartmentalization (isolation)
		- break system in different parts
		- minimize privileges in each part
		- dont implement all or nothing model
			- minimizes possible damage
	- Sandbox
		- java sandbox 
		- VM's 
	- Authorization should only be provided to those who require it
		- not everybody needs to be able to do everything
- #### Least Privilege
	- subjects posses the minium required authority to complete their task
- #### Least Common Mechanism
	- Privilege hierarchy 
		- OS
		- Users and Processes with System Privileges 
		- Users and Processes
		- Unprivileged Processes
	- Ring 0 - 3 etc....
- #### Psychological Acceptability
	- easy to use GUI

### Layer Defenses / Protections
- firewall
- anti-virus
- bit-locker
- user authentication
- secure boot
- kernel protections
