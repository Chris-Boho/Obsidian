## Auditing, Testing, and Monitoring
- A security audit is a crucial type of evaluation to avoid a data breach
- Auditing a computer system involves checking to see how its operation has met security goals
- Audit tests my be manual or automated

## Purpose of Audits
- Appropriateness of Controls
	- is the level of security control suitable for the risk it addresses?
- Correct Installation of Controls
	- is the security control in the right place and working well?
- Addresses Purpose of Controls
	- is the security control effective in addressing the risk it was designed to address?

## Assessment 
- find deficiencies
- test security controls
- result in the current state of the security system

## Gap Analysis
- compares existing security controls to a baseline
- maybe you have 4 cameras, but you need 10 cameras
- results in gaps

## What is Acceptable?
- define acceaptable and unacceptable actions
- create standards based on those developed or endorsed by standards bodies
- expectations from the company that they expect staff to follow

## Control Checks and Identity Management
- Approval Process: who grants approval for access requests?
- Authentication Mechanisms: what mechanisms are used for specific security requirements?
- Password Policy and Enforcement: 
- Monitoring: 
- Remote Access Systems: are all systems properly secured with strong authentication\

## Security Monitoring for Computer Systems
- Real-time monitoring:
	- host IDS
	- system integrity monitoring
	- data loss prevention (DLP)
- Non-real-time monitoring:
	- application logging 
	- system logging
- Log Activities:
	- host based activity
	- network and network devices

---

- NIDS: Network Intrusion Detection System
	- watches network traffic
	- watches packets
- HIDS: Host Intrusion Detection System
	- intercept and examine system calls or specific processes for patterns or behaviors that should not normally be allowed
- System Hardening: 
	- turn off unnecessary services
	- secure mangement interfaces and applications
	- protect passwords with aggressive policies
	- disable unnecessary user accounts

## Types of Log Information to Capture
- Event Logs: general OS and application software events
- Acess Logs: access requests to resources
- Security Logs: security related events
- Audit Logs: defined events that provide additional input to audit activities
